About storage.h:
At this point, the bulk of the work for data storage is finished. The Transaction class links the individual data together. The BankAccount class handles reading/writing from the file and groups the individual transactions together.

About account.txt:
This is the data I used to test the storage header. While I'm sure we will have more/different data in the end, if the account file needs to be **formatted** differently then please let me know as soon as possible because multiple classes in storage are expecting data in this format.
